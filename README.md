# Midi-Mappings-Configs
The name says it all.

The intent is to build a database for the MPC in this area, I've not yet added content to this area other than a mapping for Mixxx and the Nurmark Mixdeck Express.. I wish there was a way to maybe get some community members on-board with such an idea... we could roll roms that would be way more versitile than akai's oob experience. We (*I*) need pc user's to contibute their maps for the standalone to expand.
